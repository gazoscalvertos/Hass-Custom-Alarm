code: !secret alarm_code #Code, should consist of one or more digits ie '6482' ensure your passcode is encapsulated by quotes
panic_code: !secret panic_code #[OPTIONAL] Panic Code should consist of one or more digits ie '9876' ensure your passcode is encapsulated by quotes, it needs to be different to your standard alarm code. This enables a special panic mode. This can be used under duress to deactivate the alarm which would appear to the unseeing eye as deactivated however a special attribute [panic_mode] listed under the alarm_control_panel.[identifier] will change to ACTIVE. This status could be used in your automations to send a notification to someone else police/spouse/sibling/neighbour that you are under duress. To deactive this mode arm then disarm your alarm in the usual manner. 

pending_time: 25 #Grace time in seconds to allow for exit and entry using Away mode
trigger_time: 600

alarm: automation.alarm_triggered
warning: automation.alarm_warning

##[OPTIONAL SETTINGS] 
clock: True  #[Optional] - False by default. True enables a clock in the center of the status bar
perimeter_mode: True #[Optional] - False by default. True enables perimeter mode, this could be known as 'Day Mode' i.e. only arm the doors whilst there is someone using all floors
weather: True #[Optional] - False by Default. Allows a weather summary to be displayed on the status bar. Dark Sky weather component must be enabled with the name sensor.dark_sky_summary
#settings: True #[NOT YET IMPLEMENTED, OPTIONAL] True/False. Enables a settings mode which allows you to define certain settings in the UI without the need to restart HA after certain config changes. This will be used for fluid settings such as enabling/disabling the screensaver mode once implmented. NOTE for this to work you will need to create a directory within your HA config directory named 'alarm_settings' this is where the settings file will be managed. Also ensure you have the appropriate permissions/ownership for the HA user to create/amend the file.
hide_passcode: True #[OPTIONAL] - True by default. This is a security feature when enabled hides the passcode while entering disarm code.
hide_sidebar: True #[OPTIONAL] - False by default. This is a security feature when enabled hides the HA sidebar when the alarm is armed. The sidebar re-appears when the alarm is disarmed.
#hide_all_sensors: True #[NOT YET IMPLEMENTED, Optional] - False by default. Setting this to True hides the 'All Sensors' box which displays every sensor when in disarmed mode.

##[PASSCODE RELATED]
#passcode_attempts: 3 #[Optional] Disabled if commented out. When a value equal or greater than 0 is set, the system will only allow the set amount of password attempts before timing out
#passcode_attempts_timeout: 30 #[Optional] Default 30 seconds. When set with the password attempts option the panel will timeout for the amount of seconds set if the password is entered incorrectly as per the password_attempts option. The system will then reset the allowed password attempts

##[MQTT RELATED]
#mqtt: True #[OPTIONAL] - False by default. Settings this to True will enable MQTT Mode. Uncomment options below to use See the README for guidance.
#override_code: True #[OPTIONAL] False by default. if true allows MQTT commands to disarm the alarm without a valid code.
#state_topic: 'home/alarm' #[OPTIONAL] The MQTT topic HA will publish state updates to.
#command_topic: 'home/alarm/set' #[OPTIONAL] The MQTT topic HA will subscribe to, to receive commands from a remote device to change the alarm state.
#qos: 0 #[OPTIONAL] The maximum QoS level for subscribing and publishing to MQTT messages. Default is 0.
#payload_disarm: "DISARM" #[OPTIONAL] The payload to disarm this Alarm Panel. Default is “DISARM”.
#payload_arm_home: "ARM_HOME" #[OPTIONAL] The payload to set armed-home mode on this Alarm Panel. Default is “ARM_HOME”.
#payload_arm_away: "ARM_AWAY" #[OPTIONAL] The payload to set armed-away mode on this Alarm Panel. Default is “ARM_AWAY”.
#payload_arm_night: "ARM_NIGHT" #[OPTIONAL] The payload to set armed-night mode on this Alarm Panel. Default is “ARM_NIGHT”.

############# SENSOR GROUPS ########################
##Sensors in this group tigger the alarm immediately
immediate:
  - binary_sensor.top_floor_multi_sensor_sensor
  - binary_sensor.lounge_multi_sensor_sensor
  - binary_sensor.toilet_window_sensor
  - binary_sensor.back_door_sensor
  - binary_sensor.lounge_doors_sensor
  - binary_sensor.kitchen_window_sensor

##Sensors in this group start the clock (pending_time) when tripped before the alarm is activated in 'Away' mode
delayed:
  - binary_sensor.kitchen_multi_sensor_sensor
  - binary_sensor.hall_multi_sensor_sensor
  - binary_sensor.toilet_multi_sensor_sensor
  - binary_sensor.front_door_sensor
  - binary_sensor.garage_door_sensor

##Same as notathome but hopefully the title is more self explanatory. Can still use notathome for backwards compatibility
##Note sensors can exist in more than one group notice top_floor appears in two groups
homemodeignore:
  - binary_sensor.top_floor_multi_sensor_sensor
##Use this group to automatically override the warning message on open sensors when setting 'away' mode. (I use this as I have a motion sensor at the front door)
override:
  - binary_sensor.hall_multi_sensor_sensor

##This group is special and only effects 'perimeter mode'. If perimeter_mode is enabled then any sensor in this group will trigger the alarm immediately if arm perimeter is set. There is no delayed group for this mode (unless requested as a feature of course!)
perimeter:
  - binary_sensor.toilet_window_sensor
  - binary_sensor.back_door_sensor
  - binary_sensor.lounge_doors_sensor
  - binary_sensor.kitchen_window_sensor
  - binary_sensor.front_door_sensor
  - binary_sensor.garage_door_sensor

##[OPTIONAL] - CUSTOM SENSOR STATUSES - These settings allow devices which are not natively supported by this panel to be used. 
##This is to be used when the state of the device is not recognised by the panel. Examples are provided below 
#custom_supported_statuses_on:
#  - 'running' #EXAMPLE
#  - flipped #EXAMPLE
#custom_supported_statuses_off:
#  - 'not_running' #EXAMPLE
#  - unflipped   #EXAMPLE
