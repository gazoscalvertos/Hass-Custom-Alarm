############# SENSOR GROUPS ########################
# Sensors in this group tigger the alarm immediately
immediate:
  - binary_sensor.top_floor_multi_sensor_sensor
  - binary_sensor.lounge_multi_sensor_sensor
  - binary_sensor.toilet_window_sensor
  - binary_sensor.back_door_sensor
  - binary_sensor.lounge_doors_sensor
  - binary_sensor.kitchen_window_sensor

# Sensors in this group start the clock (pending_time) when tripped before the alarm is activated in 'Away' mode
delayed:
  - binary_sensor.kitchen_multi_sensor_sensor
  - binary_sensor.hall_multi_sensor_sensor
  - binary_sensor.toilet_multi_sensor_sensor
  - binary_sensor.front_door_sensor
  - binary_sensor.garage_door_sensor

# Same as notathome but hopefully the title is more self explanatory. Can still use notathome for backwards compatibility
# Note sensors can exist in more than one group notice top_floor appears in two groups
homemodeignore:
  - binary_sensor.top_floor_multi_sensor_sensor
  - binary_sensor.lounge_multi_sensor_sensor
# Use this group to automatically override the warning message on open sensors when setting 'away' mode. (I use this as I have a motion sensor at the front door)
#override:
#  - binary_sensor.hall_multi_sensor_sensor

# This group is special and only effects 'perimeter mode'. If perimeter_mode is enabled then any sensor in this group will trigger the alarm immediately if arm perimeter is set. There is no delayed group for this mode (unless requested as a feature of course!)
