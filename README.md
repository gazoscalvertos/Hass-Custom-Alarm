# Home Assistant - Custom Alarm Interface!
## Intro :-)

Welcome my fellow modders, tinkerers, home assistant wizards!!

Follow the thread [here](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/yet-another-take-on-an-alarm-system/32386)

Consider donating to this project to keep it going as anything contributed will be placed back in to enable more hardware integration, new features and bug squashing.

This is very much a community project so if you wish to chip in then please do!! I could really use a CSS, animation, design guru to make this look amazing. Also please feel free to leave comments, suggestions, enhancements and fixes!!

**NOTE!!! MAJOR CHANGE** It's time to publish the New UI and settings into the master release.

## Installation

You will need to copy the following files into your home assistant configuration directory

alarm.yaml	*This files stores your alarm configuration. An options page will be created for this file*

custom_components/alarm_control_panel/bwalarm.py *The brains of the operation. This is the logic of the custom alarm system*
panels/alarm.html *This is the interface for the custom alarm component. It's actually optional as the alarm will function without it but recommended for ease of setup*

www/alarm/ [COPY ALL FILES] *These files control how the interface looks and feels*

www/lib/ [COPY ALL FILES] *These files add additional functionality to the interface in order to work*
www/images/ha.png *An image file used for the interface log*

To get things working with Home Assistant (HA) you will need to adjust your configuration.yaml to instruct HA to use your new custom alarm component, add the following to this file:
```
alarm_control_panel: !include alarm.yaml
```
You will also need to tell HA where your new panel interface file is. Also add the following to your configuration.yaml:
```
panel_custom: !include panel_custom.yaml
```
You may need to restart HA if the component doesn't load first time as HA will need to install a dependency (ruamel.yaml).

It's advisable to start with a new alarm.yaml file with the minimum configuration set:
```
platform: bwalarm
name: House
```
Your new interface can be used to modify your alarm.yaml directly.

The default password to access the settings page is: **HG28!!&dn**

Please test and provide feedback/suggestions.
